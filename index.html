 <h1 id="Independence day">Independence day</h1><p> independence Day is a day to exhibit pride, unity and integrity among all Indians. The current year 2023 marks the 77th anniversary of the country’s independence from the Britishers’ rule. For almost 200 years, India was reigned by Britishers miserably. Britishers established colonial rule on Indians and treated them as slaves. During Midnight on 15th August 1947, a light at the end of the tunnel struck when Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru unfurled our National Flag at Red Fort and hoisted the tricolour flag as a mark of independent India.

Under Britishers’ rule, the life of Indians was pitiful as they were treated in an inhumane manner. The Indian rulers were given no powers to take action and some rulers were also banished. Indian soldiers’ army was devastated and Indian farmers were charged heavy taxes on lands. Several farmers died out of hunger and poverty which was very pathetic. To put an end to all such cruelties, several freedom fighters namely Mahatma Gandhi, Subhash Chandra Bose, Bhagat Singh, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Jawaharlal Nehru, Rani Lakshmi Bai, Mangal Pandey, Dada Bhai Naoroji have sacrificed their lives to get freedom for India. A sincere tribute is given to all such leaders on every independence day on remembering their sacrifices and efforts.

<h1 id="celebration"> celebration </h1><p>ndependence Day, one of the three National holidays in India (the other two being the Republic Day on 26 January and Mahatma Gandhi's birthday on 2 October), is observed in all Indian states and union territories. On the eve of Independence Day, the President of India delivers the "Address to the Nation". On 15 August, the Prime Minister hoists the Indian flag on the ramparts of the historical site of Red Fort in Delhi.[1] In his speech, the Prime Minister highlights the past year's achievements, raises important issues and calls for further development. He pays tribute to the leaders of the Indian independence movement. The Indian national anthem, "Jana Gana Mana", is sung. The speech is followed by a march past of divisions of the Indian Armed Forces and paramilitary forces. Parades and pageants showcase scenes from the independence struggle and India's diverse cultural traditions. Similar events take place in state capitals where the Chief Ministers of individual states unfurl the national flag, followed by parades and pageants.[26][27] Until 1973, the Governor of the State hoisted the National Flag at the State capital. In February 1974, the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, M. Karunanidhi took up the issue with then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi that the Chief Ministers, like the Prime Minister, should be allowed to hoist the national flag on Independence Day. Since 1974, Chief Ministers of the respective states have been allowed to hoist the national flag on Independence Day.[28][29]
